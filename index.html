	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		League of Legends is a competitive, online, multiplayer game that is playable on the PC. When starting a game, players are randomly selected into one of two teams. Each player, typically referred to as "summoner", can choose from a multitude of champions to engage in battle with. Each champion has unique abilities and roles, so strategizing with allied champions is essential when versing opponents. The purpose of the game is very similar to that of capture the flag, in that summoners must control their champions and destroy the enemies' "nexus", a heavily guarded structure which lies at the heart of each base, while defending their own.
